## Log

### 5 May 2021

Research objective: Exploring textbook of future - using Jupyter Notebooks, one that is modular and reusable for MOOC, and community owned.

What will be the end result of the publication: 

  - Content
      - An edited collection of articles - 6 or 8 articles (lowest number to make publication substantial enough to address topic)
  - Form
      - Home on GitHub repository
      - Produced as Jupyter Notebooks (Book); multi-format - web (Github Pages), webbook (OSL flavor), EPUB, PDF, PoD
      - Source available in a variety of reusable formats
      - As knowledge graph
      - Open licensed 
  - Production
      - Released incrementally as articles and sections
      - Made for MOOC and other reuse
      - Made for participantion and community ownership
  - Review
      - Open peer review
       - Editorial board
       - Open Notebook Science
       - Hypthosis open commenting   
       
Target group for publication: 'Pedagogic architectural studio practice'- interaction and the body; city/urban data use; AI; robot control for 3D materials; 3D models; architecture and data. Note: In architecture there has been an ongoing discourse on the need for new forms of data driven, modular, collaborative publishing - driven by the dual questions of architects using so many digital tools and the cross disciplinary nature of design practice.

Ideas for contributions from OSL could be:

  - Ina Blümel talking about how an architectural object visible in Wikidata
  - André Castro and mapping publication in Wikidata to make a KG of a publication
  - Sandra Mierz including work in DataCite Commons
  - Nils Casties and Janine Doerry geolocative and architecture
